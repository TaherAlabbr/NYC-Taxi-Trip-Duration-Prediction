# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction: From Feature Engineering to Model Deployment

This project predicts the duration of taxi trips in New York City using supervised machine learning, with a **strong emphasis on feature engineering, model comparison, and real-world deployment**. It is divided into two major phases: the first focuses on EDA and interpretable feature creation using Ridge Regression, and the second benchmarks more advanced modelsâ€”including XGBoost, Neural Networks, and a stacked ensembleâ€”followed by hyperparameter tuning and API Integration.

---

## Project Overview

This project is structured into two main parts:

### â€¢ Part I: Feature Engineering and Baseline Modeling

* Extensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was conducted to identify patterns in spatial, temporal, and behavioral variables.
* More than **30 engineered features** were crafted, ranging from distance metrics and spatial interactions to temporal and behavioral indicators.
* A Ridge Regression model (Î± = 1) was used to **isolate the effect of engineered features** while minimizing the complexity of the model.
* Rigorous **IQR-based outlier removal** was tuned (k = 8) to balance between data cleaning and generalization.
* Log transformation was applied to the target variable (`trip_duration`) to reduce skewness and stabilize model training.

### â€¢ Part II: Model Comparison, Hyperparameter Tuning & API

* Benchmarked multiple models including:

  * Ridge Regression
  * XGBoost
  * Neural Network
  * A **stacked ensemble** using Ridge & XGBoost as base learners and a Neural Network as the meta-learner
* Conducted **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `max_depth=13`, `n_estimators=137` for XGBoost).
* **XGBoost** outperformed all other models and was selected for production due to its strong generalization and interpretability.
* A lightweight **API** was developed to serve real-time predictions using the best-performing model.
* A comprehensive **command-line interface (CLI)** is provided for flexible training, tuning, and deployment of all models in the project.

## ðŸ“„ Full Report

This report presents a complete machine learning pipeline for NYC taxi trip duration prediction. It includes:

* **Extensive Feature Engineering**: From spatial transformations (e.g., Haversine distance, lat/lon sums) to temporal patterns and interaction effects.
* **Robust Data Preprocessing**: Outlier detection using the IQR method (with an optimal multiplier of *k = 8*), log transformation of the target variable, and strict separation of training and validation sets to prevent data leakage.
* **Model Development and Comparison**: Evaluation of Ridge Regression, XGBoost, Neural Network, and a stacked ensembleâ€”with XGBoost emerging as the top-performing model.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Randomized search was used to identify the best configurations for each model, improving generalization and stability.
* **Final Results**: The best model (XGBoost) achieved an RÂ² score of **0.759** and RMSE of **0.380** on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive performance.
