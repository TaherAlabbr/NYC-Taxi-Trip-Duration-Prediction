# ðŸš– NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction: A Feature Engineering-Centric Approach

This project predicts the duration of taxi trips in New York City using supervised machine learning, with a **strong emphasis on feature engineering**. A single, interpretable modelâ€”**Ridge Regression (Î± = 1)**â€”is used throughout to highlight the impact of each transformation and engineered feature.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information about taxi rides in NYC, such as timestamps, pickup/dropoff coordinates, and passenger count.

* Target: `trip_duration` (in seconds)
* Key features: `pickup_datetime`, `dropoff_datetime`, `passenger_count`, `pickup/dropoff lat/lon`, `vendor_id`, and more

---

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights

* Applied **log transformation** to the skewed target variable (`trip_duration`) to stabilize variance and improve correlation.
* Performed detailed **EDA** to uncover trends across time, location, and passenger behavior.
* Designed and evaluated **30+ engineered features**, including:

  * Haversine-based `trip_distance` and interaction terms
  * `latitude_sum`, `longitude_sum` to simplify spatial encoding
  * Time-of-day, day-of-week, seasonal flags
* Conducted **IQR-based outlier removal** and tuned strictness parameter `k` using validation RÂ² performance.
* Ensured **data leakage prevention** by computing thresholds from the training set only.
* Achieved RÂ² score of **0.68688** on validation set using only Ridge Regression.
